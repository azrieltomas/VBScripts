# VBScripts
A collection of VB scripts for use in MS Excel

Each folder covers a different Excel sheet and designed to all work within a single VBA Module.  
(ie, combine all the scripts into one module)   
constants.vbs defines the various constants used throughout the rest of the scripts (in that folder).
